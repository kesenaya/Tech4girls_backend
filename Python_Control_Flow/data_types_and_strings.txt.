Sequence data type;
3. str: data type used in programming, that is used to represent text rather than numbers. it is immutable
eg. greeting ="hi"
    name ="bonnie"
    message =greeting +","+ name
LIST; this is a data structure that is mutable. it is denominated by []
eg. List1 = ['cat', 'dog']
TUPLE; similar to list only difference is that it is immutable and it is denominated by parantheses
eg. Tuple1 =(1,6, 2,6,)
SET;it is usedto store multiple values in a single variable. it values is denominated by {}
eg.Set1 ={0,9,8,7,6,}"""
