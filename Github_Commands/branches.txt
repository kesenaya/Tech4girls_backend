The linux home directory is a personnal space for the each user,typically located at/home/username,where "username"is the users name 
it serves as the default directory upon logging in and it contains individual files and settings.
The root users home directory is located at /root/,granting it control over all system files and directory
The git pull command is used to update your local version of a repository by getting the latest changes from a remote repository. 
You would use it when you're working on a project with other people and want to make sure your code is up to date with what everyone else has done.
 Basically, it does two things: it first fetches the new updates (like using git fetch) and then merges them into your current branch (like git merge).
  It's super important for keeping everything in sync when multiple people are working on the same project!
