 An absolute path is the location of a file or directory specified from the root directory. It represents the complete path from the start of the filesystem from the root directory.
 A relative path is the location of a file or directory relative to your current working directory. Unlike an absolute path, the relative path doesn't start with a slash or drive letter since it doesn't start from the root directory.
