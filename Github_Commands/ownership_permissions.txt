In Linux, file ownership and permissions control access to files and directories. Each file has three owners:
User: The creator with full control.
Group: A set of users sharing permissions.
Others: Everyone else.
File Permission
There are three main types:
Read (r): View or copy the file; list directory contents.
Write (w): Modify the file; add or delete files in a directory.
Execute (x): Run the file as a program; enter a directory.
Changing Permissions
Permissions can be modified using the chmod command in two ways:
Symbolic Mode: Uses letters to add/remove permissions (e.g., chmod u+x filename).
Absolute Mode: Uses numbers to set permissions (e.g., chmod 755 filename).
These concepts are crucial for managing security and access in a multi-userÂ environment.
